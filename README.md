Started with header to begin webpage and titled it Lerantinno's Portfolio in so that his future employeers will know that this webpage is his portfolio.

Underneath the title of the webpage, I added buttons Home, About Me, Contact and Resume so that my employeers can easily access important information about me

I made a clear insentive of what Lerantinno wants from his future employeers. Which is to be hired.


I used <main> to have viewers focus on the center of the page listing Lerantinno's Location, Academics, Work Experience, Certifications and References

I added small quips underneath each section to entice employeers to click on page (although I had trouble connecting a clickable link to image so it doesn't really work)

I gave an easy contact list listing my number, github, twitter and spotify (so they can listen to my beats)
